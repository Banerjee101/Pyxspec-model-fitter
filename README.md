# Pyxspec-model-fitter
This is the model fitting code that I wrote to recursively scan through an ascii file and fit all the models mentioned in it as an additive model to the energy spectra, and generate an output with the reduced chi squared and the degree of freedom to another text file. 
This code is under works since this is only useful if the data is gaussian. i am editing the model fitting code if the data is poissonian
